## @0xproject/subproviders

A few useful web3 subproviders including a LedgerSubprovider useful for adding Ledger Nano S support.

We have written up a [Wiki](https://0xproject.com/wiki#Web3-Provider-Examples) article detailing some use cases of this subprovider package.

## Installation

```
yarn add @0xproject/subproviders
```

## Usage

Simply import the subprovider you are interested in using:

```javascript
import {
    ledgerEthereumBrowserClientFactoryAsync as ledgerEthereumClientFactoryAsync,
    LedgerSubprovider,
} from '@0xproject/subproviders';

const ledgerSubprovider = new LedgerSubprovider({
    networkId,
    ledgerEthereumClientFactoryAsync,
});

const accounts = await ledgerSubprovider.getAccountsAsync();
```

### Subproviders

#### Ledger Nano S subprovider

A subprovider that enables your dApp to send signing requests to a user's Ledger Nano S hardware wallet. These can be requests to sign transactions or messages.

#### Redundant RPC subprovider

A subprovider which attempts to send an RPC call to a list of RPC endpoints sequentially, until one of them returns a successful response.

#### Injected Web3 subprovider

A subprovider that relays all signing related requests to a particular provider (in our case the provider injected onto the web page), while sending all other requests to a different provider (perhaps your own backing Ethereum node or Infura).
